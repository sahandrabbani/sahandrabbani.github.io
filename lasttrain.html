<bodystyle>
Light, soporific turbulence<br>
Extinguishes the child's sorrow<br>
As an exhausted father counts the dots<br>
To Finchley Road<br>
Along the banner above the sliding doors.<br>
<br>
A silk red tie hangs loose around an enervated neck<br>
That belongs to a tuxedoed man<br>
And his slackened pride.<br>
<br>
Lonely grandmother of seven holds in her lap<br>
An imitation purse of leather and fabric, a gift from<br>
Her second daughter.<br>
<br>
Ragged is the man who makes the underground<br>
His home,<br>
And the momentary comfort of the train's bench<br>
His bed.<br>
<br>
The last train stops at Finchley Road<br>
As it has most days in the memories<br>
Of those who are relevant.<br>
<br>
The doors open and close<br>
And the recording plays<br>
Like it has most days in the memories<br>
Of those who are relevant.<br>
<br>
But the passengers sit unflinchingly.<br>
<br>
All who live near Finchley Road<br>
Are either home already,<br>
Away for the night,<br>
Or will find another ride home.<br>
