<b>from Berlin II</b><br><br>
<br>
Dear Friends,<br><br>
With a six-hour layover in Berlin's Tegel Airport, I thought I'd pass the time in the city. Arriving on an overnight Airberlin flight from Chicago where I slept none, read, and watched several episodes of the <i>Big Bang Theory</i> thanks to the generously stocked in-seat entertainment system, I was particularly exhausted. Adrenaline kept me moving for the next several hours as I checked my suitcase at the airport and plowed through several modes of transit (bus, S-bahn, U-bahn) into town. I targeted a self-involved coffee shop in the Mitte district referenced in the <i>New York Times</i> "36 Hours" column and passed the morning drinking coffee and eating lots of those delicious German sandwiches made with fresh artisan bread and cured meats and vegetables. Afterwards, I ambled east along the river for five kilometers in the hopes of tracking down a doner kebab for lunch in the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district, but my clock ran out and I had to duck into an U-bahn station before my meal to race back to the airport.<br><br>
My memories of Berlin from my visit in 2008 were faint (see "<a href="vienna.html">from Austria (Vienna), Slovakia (Bratislava), Germany (Berlin)</a>"), but I did recognize Alexanderplatz and its imposing mall from which I bought my first international SIM card six years earlier. I was happy to be on my way to Rome, another city I was to visit again after six years.<br><br>
